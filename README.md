# Optimising hardware adders

* Livestream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7wjB2DKAIA
* The presentation slides - https://bit.ly/3MYTlCf

* Teo's main repository - https://github.com/tdene/synth_opt_adders
* Colab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bqAWs2To8suxx5acmCYp10iWlKI-Qsn4

# Aim

* Put one of each type of adder, along with the standard yosys adder
* Have a way of measuring the performance
* Tapeout on MPW6

# TODO! (prs welcome!)

* Check the instrumentation
    * how to keep the inverter loop
* Work out why everything is being optimised out
* Put the other types of adders
* Have some kind of test / simulation - doesn't seem possible with iverilog
